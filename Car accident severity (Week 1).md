2. Downloading and Prepping Data:

To provide the stakeholders with necessary information I will be analyzing car collisions that contains human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, and etc. to predict the severity.

The car collisions data is publicly available at this link: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv
